#How to build the thing

The tutorials such as [poly](doc/poly.md) are generated by tut. 

Run ```sbt tut``` to make them. DO NOT edit doc by hand.

#Coding Standard

The project has a lot of unique coding standard to follow.

Following them fully is too difficult, so it is not required for contributing to the code base. 

However, a refactoring moving toward such standard is always appreciated

0. For every function F: Repr[A => B => C], define F\_: Repr[A] => Repr[B => C], and F\_\_: Repr[A] => Repr[B] => Repr[C], and so on. Unnecessary info should be removed.

1. Every Implementation is a trait(for composability), and has an companion object verifying that all undefined trait interface had been considered.

2. Two function that has no fundamental connection can be seperated (I can pick one in my language, excluding another)

3. Do stuff in Finally Tagless style so that stuff are extensible.

4. Maintain avg LOC/File <= 25

5. Coercion should not appeared in anywhere except typecase

6. Lang has all constructor.

7. Each Tagless trait TRAIT has TRAITExt which require sub tagless trait, but defined all other operation, so it is easy to compose TRAIT from it's subtrait.

8. Every Destructor implemented Lang

9. If a feature is implemented, update FEATURES.md
